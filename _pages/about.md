  I'm Song, a second-year PhD student at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) at Switzerland, my research interest includes chemical biology, chemical sensors design and drug development.  
  I will upload my life moments here, mostly the photos and some interesting thoughts. I will upload my CV soon, as something will happen.
